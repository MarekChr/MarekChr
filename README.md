# Hi there 👋
I’m currently working full-stack on my proprietary software for managing registration data in parishes using Java 17 ☕

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**&**

Multifunctional web application used as evidence and process-simplifier in work field used by security technicians, lecturers, nurses and personal managers in Java 21 ☕ with Vaadin 🇻, Spring-Boot 🍃, Debian 🐧, Lombok 🌶️, MySQL 🐬

I’m looking to collaborate on **meaningful, non-bloatware software for people without main focus on profit, but on quality and user needs**
